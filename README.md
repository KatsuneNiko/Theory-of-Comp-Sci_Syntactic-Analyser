# Theory of Computing Science - Syntactic Analyser
 This is an application that builds upon the lexical analyser implementation in Assignment 1 to create a syntactic analyser, using a DFA implementation combined with a stack. The program is a parser that checks the syntactic correctness of a simplfieid subset of the Java programming language, and builds a parse tree representing the program if correct.
