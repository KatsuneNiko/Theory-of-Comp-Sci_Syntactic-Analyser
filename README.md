# Theory of Comp Sci_Syntactic Analyser
 This is an application that builds upon the lexical analyser implementation to create a syntactic analyser, also using a DFA structure, but this time with a stack. The program is a parser that checks the syntactic correctness of a simplfieid subset of the Java programming language, and builds a parse tree representing the program if correct.
